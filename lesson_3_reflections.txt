When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share your job with other people and if your not in your local computer so you can work in another place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Cause its easier to know when I want to save a change rather than make a change automatically that maybe I didnt want it saved.
